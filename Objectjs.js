//An object in JavaScript is a data structure used to store related data collections. It stores data as key-value pairs, where each key is a unique identifier for the associated value. Objects are dynamic, which means the properties can be added, modified, or deleted at runtime.
//There are two primary ways to create an object in JavaScript: Object Literal and Object Constructor.

//1. Creation Using Object Literal
let obj1 = {
    name: "aniket",
    age: 27,
    job: "nalavade"
};
console.log(obj);
console.log(obj.age);

//2.Creation Using new Object() Constructor
let obj2 = new Object();
obj2.name= "pankaj",
obj2.age= 23,
obj2.job= "patil"

console.log(obj2);
console.log(obj2.age);
